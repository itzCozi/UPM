# UPM
Universal Program Manager is a version control system similar to git. This program uses a file system to store versions of your selected file and other items like commits and builds and soon releases! This program is under active updates so remember to check back for the [latest release](https://github.com/itzCozi/UPM/releases) and [follow development](https://github.com/users/itzCozi/projects/4/views/1) of upm.

## Release 1.0
[Release 1.0](https://github.com/itzCozi/UPM/releases/tag/1.0) is out! My most ambitious project yet.
